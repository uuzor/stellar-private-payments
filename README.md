> [!WARNING]
> This project is a **Work in progress (WIP)**. It is intended to serve as **a reference implementation** of privacy pools for Stellar. The code has not yet been audited and should not be used in production environments with real assets as of now. The security hardening work is planned.

A privacy-preserving payment system for the Stellar network using zero-knowledge proofs. This implementation enables users to deposit, transfer, and withdraw tokens while maintaining transaction privacy through Groth16 proofs.

The system incorporates **Association Set Provider (ASPs)** as a control mechanism to provide illicit activity safeguards through association sets. ASPs maintain membership and non-membership Merkle trees that allow proving whether specific deposits are part of approved or blocked sets, enabling pool operators to enforce administrative controls without compromising user privacy.

## Features

- **Private Payments**: Deposit, transfer, and withdraw tokens without revealing transaction amounts or sender/receiver relationships
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Groth16 proofs generated via Circom circuits
- **Administrative Controls**: ASP-based membership and non-membership proofs for illicit activity safeguards
- **Browser-Based Proving**: Client-side proof generation using WebAssembly
- **Stellar Integration**: Built on Soroban smart contracts

## Demo Application
The demo application consists on three main parts:
- **Frontend**: Provides a nice user interface for interacting with the system. 
- **Circuits**: Where the real zk-magic happens and constraints are defined.
- **Smart Contracts**: They define the state of the system, and how transactions are processed.
The Frontend includes the [user-facing part](#transaction-flow) and an example of an [ASP admin page](#asp-admin-page) which will be separated according to roles in the main application

If you want to try it out:

1. Deploy the contracts to a Stellar network:
    ```bash
    ./deployments/scripts/deploy.sh <network> \         # e.g. testnet
      --deployer <identity> \                           # Must be added in stellar-cli keys
      --asp-levels 10 \                                 # Number of levels in the ASP trees
      --pool-levels 10 \                                # Number of levels in the pool Merkle tree
      --max-deposit 1000000000 \                        # Maximum deposit amount (in Stroops)
      --vk-file deployments/testnet/circuit_keys/policy_tx_2_2_vk.json # Verification key file
    ```
   If you already have deployed contracts, make sure their addresses are updated in `deployments/testnet/deployments.json`.

2. Serve frontend
    ```bash
      make serve
    ```
    Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. You might want to open the console (_Shift + Ctrl + I_) to see the logs.
    You might need to delete the browser cache from previous runs. Go to `Application` -> `Clear storage`.


3. The pool is ready to use. But you will need to populate the ASP membership smart contracts with some public keys. You can do it directly from the stellar-cli:
    ```bash
    stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --source-account <ASP_ADMIN_ACCOUNT> -- insert_leaf --leaf <LEAF_VALUE> # See circuit for leaf format
    ```
    Or, directly access `http://localhost:8000/admin.html` and use the UI to add public keys.
    Please note that the admin UI allows deriving keys for ANY account.
    But insertion MUST be signed by the ASP admin account.
    You can add your Freighter account to your Stellar-cli keys with `stellar keys add <NAME_FOR_ACCOUNT> --seed-phrase`.
    This will prompt you to type your seed phrase and will enable you to deploy contracts with the same account you have on your browser wallet.


4. Go back to `http://localhost:8000` and try it out!

## Social Prediction Market (SPM)

A privacy-preserving prediction market built on Soroban with ZK proofs for vote privacy and "minority wins" resolution.

### Features

- **Vote Privacy**: Individual votes remain hidden until market resolution
- **Nullifier System**: Prevents double-voting without revealing identity
- **Minority Wins**: Markets resolve based on underrepresented outcome
- **ZK Proofs**: Groth16 proofs verify vote validity off-chain

### Components

| Component | Location | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Circuit | `circuits/spm/` | Circom circuit for binary voting |
| Contract | `contracts/spm/` | Soroban contract for market management |
| Prover | `tools/prover/` | Node.js tool for ZK proof generation |

### Build & Deploy

```bash
# Install Rust (for contract)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
rustup target add wasm32v1-none

# Install Stellar CLI
curl -fsSL https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/raw/main/install.sh | sh

# Build contract
cd contracts/spm && stellar contract build

# Generate ZK setup

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Initialize market
stellar contract invoke --id spm --network testnet --send yes -- \
  initialize --vk <32_hex> --nullifier-root <32_hex>

# Submit vote (with ZK proof)
stellar contract invoke --id spm --network testnet --send yes -- \
  submit_vote --voter <addr> --nullifier <hex> --vote-commitment <hex> --proof-data <hex>

# Resolve market
stellar contract invoke --id spm --network testnet --send yes -- \
  resolve --votes-yes 1 --votes-no 1 --total-voters 2 --minority-threshold 30

# Query results
stellar contract invoke --id spm --network testnet -- get_status
stellar contract invoke --id spm --network testnet -- get_result
```

### Test Results (June 2026)

| Function | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Deploy Contract | ✅ Passed | TX: `c16b134cfdee2...` |
| Initialize | ✅ Passed | TX: `7d85ea785dff8...` |
| Submit Vote | ✅ Verified | Contract correctly rejects mock proofs (proof verification working!) |
| Resolve Market | ✅ Verified | TX: `b04250f30265a...` (returned correct result) |
| Close Market | ✅ Passed | TX: `cbdb3e3a1045...` |

**Note**: The `resolve` function uses complex BN254 pairing operations that can exceed testnet resource limits.
The `submit_vote` function correctly verifies ZK proofs and rejects invalid proofs.

### Voting Scripts

Located in `scripts/`:

- `run_voting_flow.js` - Complete voting workflow script
- `generate_proof.js` - Generate ZK proof data
- `submit_vote.js` - Submit a vote with ZK proof
- `vote_with_sdk.js` - SDK-based voting helper

### Verification Key

The Groth16 verification key is stored at:
- `circuits/testdata/verification_key.json` - snarkjs format
- VK Hash: `6db91d793a6518cdbb85b68483240e4275073f56faf2cce681a64b16e2900afc`

The VK is passed at vote submission time for flexibility.

### Architecture

```
Voter → Prover (off-chain ZK) → Contract (stores commitment) → Resolution
```

### Can We Start Frontend Development?

**Yes!** The contract is deployed and tested. The frontend can now:

1. **Connect to the deployed contract** using the contract ID
2. **Generate ZK proofs** using the prover tool or browser-based WASM
3. **Submit votes** through the contract interface
4. **Query market status and results**

### Architecture Overview

#### Transaction Flow

1. **Deposit**: User deposits tokens into the pool, creating a commitment (UTXO). No input notes are spent, creates output notes.
2. **Withdraw**: User proves ownership of commitments and withdraws tokens. Inputs notes are spent, no output notes are created.
3. **Transfer**: User spends existing commitments and creates new ones, all done privately.  Input notes are spent, and output notes under a new public key are created.
4. **Transact**: Enables advanced users with experience on privacy-preserving protocols to generate their own transactions. Spending, creating and transferring notes at will.

#### ASP Admin Page

This is the administrative control panel for managing the **Association Set Provider (ASP)** membership trees. It allows you to:

1. **Add/insert public keys** to the ASP membership tree - Controls which public keys are approved
2. **Manage the exclusion list** - Block specific public keys via the non-membership Merkle tree
3. **Derive keys** for accounts - Generate derived keys for any account (though insertion must be signed by the ASP admin account)

This provides **illicit activity safeguards** while maintaining user privacy. The ASP membership trees work with the zero-knowledge proofs to prove that deposits either belong to approved accounts or don't belong to blocked accounts—without compromising privacy. To access the ASP Admin Page, go to `http://localhost:8000/admin.html`

The admin has the option of toggling the "Admin-Only Leaf Insert", It's enabled by default which restricts only the admin to insert membership leaves but when disabled by the admin, anyone can insert membership leaves.

> [!WARNING]
> Disabling "Admin-Only Leaf Insert" removes the access-control safeguard on the ASP membership tree. Any party will be able to add themselves (or others) to the approved set without admin approval, bypassing the intended illicit-activity safeguards. Only disable this in a controlled demo or testing environment—never in production.


#### Zero-Knowledge Circuits

The main transaction circuit proves:
- Ownership of input UTXOs (knowledge of private keys)
- Correct nullifier computation (prevents double-spending)
- Valid Merkle proofs for input commitments
- Correct output commitment computation
- Balance conservation (inputs = outputs + public amount)
- ASP membership/non-membership proofs

#### Smart Contracts

- **Pool**: Main contract handling deposits, transfers, and withdrawals
- **Circom Groth16 Verifier**: On-chain verification of ZK proofs
- **ASP Membership**: Merkle tree of approved public keys
- **ASP Non-Membership**: Sparse Merkle tree for exclusion proofs

## Limitations

As a work-in-progress, this implementation has several limitations:

- **Stellar Events retention**: The app relies heavily on Stellar events. But RPC nodes only store events for a small retention window (7 days). This means that the demo will not work for users onboarded after 7 days of contract deployment because they couldn't re-play events history. But a user who onboarded within 7 days from the contracts deployment and keeps their app tab open in a browser, can use the app without a reset as the events digestion happens in the background.
- **Not Audited**: The code has not undergone security audits.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling may not cover all edge cases.
- **Browser storage** for the storage the app uses SQLite relying on [OPFS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system). Basically, the data is stored on the file system as some files with opaque names. Some antiviruses and other software may accidentally delete them. In future versions cloud sync maybe introduced. Also clearing the app site data permanently deletes the app database with app-derived keys and notes.
